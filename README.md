Hello, I'm John Scaly!

💻 Junior Frontend Developer | Student | Future Full-Stack Engineer

**I am a frontend developer with a serious and professional approach to my work.  
For the second year in a row, I’ve been delivering projects where clean architecture, performance, and scalability are the foundation.**

**My focus is on code quality, stability, and logical structure.  
I don’t just build interfaces — I create complete, user-friendly, and responsive solutions.  
Attention to detail, precise layout, and well-thought-out logic are essential parts of every project I work on.**

**I use modern technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue, Tailwind, and more.  
Meeting deadlines, maintaining high standards, and never compromising on quality — that’s how I work.**

**I’m not new to the field. I understand the demands of the market and deliver results —  
precisely, consistently, and professionally.**
