Hello, I'm John Scaly!

💻 Junior Frontend Developer | Student | Future Full-Stack Engineer

I am a frontend developer with a serious and professional approach to my work. For the second year in a row, I’ve been delivering projects where clean architecture, performance, and scalability are the foundation.

My focus is on code quality, stability, and logical structure. I don’t just build interfaces — I create complete, user-friendly, and responsive solutions. Attention to detail, precise layout, and well-thought-out logic are essential parts of every project I work on.

I use modern technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue, Tailwind, and more. Meeting deadlines, maintaining high standards, and never compromising on quality — that’s how I work.

I'm not new to the field. I understand the demands of the market and deliver results — precisely, consistently, and professionally.
